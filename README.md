The project follows a basic React project structure with the following key directories and files:

- public: Contains static assets and the HTML file for the app.
- src: Contains the source code for the application.
  - assets: Contains fonts and images.
  - components: Contains the React components used in the app.
  - hooks: Contains the hooks used in the app.
  - layouts: Contains the layouts for all pages.
  - mockData: Save the dummy data for the app.
  - pages: Show all pages of the app.
  - App.tsx: define all pages.
  - index.js: Entry point of the application.

## Improvement for the future:

- Update the design. There are some micro issues in text. E.g: font-size, line-height, letter-spacing. Look like is it not the same format.
- Load more feature. Actually, I need more time to work on it.
- Write Unit test.
